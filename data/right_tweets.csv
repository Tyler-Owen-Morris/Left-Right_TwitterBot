3,"Told that @NYCMayor Bill de Blasio wants to paint the fabled &amp; beautiful Fifth Avenue, right in front of Trump Tower/Tiffany, with a big yellow Black Lives Matter sign. “Pigs in a Blanket, Fry ‘Em Like Bacon”, referring to killing Police, is their chant. NYC Police are furious!"
4,"Black Lives Matter leader states, “If U.S. doesn’t give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it”. This is Treason, Sedition, Insurrection!"

6,"When are the thugs, looters, and anarchists moving out of the so-called “Autonomous Zone” in Seattle? Get going!"

9,The Fake News and phony Fake Suppression Polls have never been worse. The Lamestream Media has gone CRAZY!
10,"A @FoxNews commentator just ripped me with lies, with nobody defending. They talked about the “friendly” protesters (they set the Church on fire the day before. They were anything but friendly), and how I stood and held the Bible upside down - it wasn’t upside down. @edhenry"

14,"Very sad to see States allowing roving gangs of wise guys, anarchists &amp; looters, many of them having no idea what they are doing, indiscriminately ripping down our statues and monuments to the past. Some are great works of art, but all represent our History &amp; Heritage, both...."

18,LAW &amp; ORDER!
19,"Is James Comey and his band of Dirty Cops going to apologize to General Michael Flynn (and many others) for what they have done to ruin his life? What about Robert Mueller and his Angry Democrat Cronies - Are they going to say, SO SORRY? And what about Obama &amp; Biden?"

29,"We did a great job on CoronaVirus, including the very early ban on China, Ventilator production, and Testing, which is by far the most, and best, in the World. We saved millions of U.S. lives.! Yet the Fake News refuses to acknowledge this in a positive way. But they do give...."
30,"There will never be an “Autonomous Zone” in Washington, D.C., as long as I’m your President. If they try they will be met with serious force!"
31,"Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country, and ever expanding. With smaller testing we would show fewer cases!"

43,WOW! The Trump Rally gives @FoxNews the “LARGEST SATURDAY NIGHT AUDIENCE IN ITS HUSTORY”. Isn’t it amazing that virtually nobody in the Lamestream Media is reporting this rather major feat!
44,"Rather hard to believe that @FoxNews didn’t know that the Border Wall is well under construction, fully financed, &amp; already over 200 miles long? Will soon be finished! They just reported that “it is something that Dems are unlikely to budge on in this election year”.  @BretBaier"

1611,"SAD TO ANNOUNCE that @jameelajamil has revoked my invitation to her podcast bc I tweeted “only women can give birth”. Apparently the statement made her trans co-workers feel “unsafe”. 

My refusal to untether myself from biological realities has cost me, yet again.

1618,"@jameelajamil Lol Jameela— with all due respect—I don’t need your name to get me press Hahaha. But I do sincerely appreciate how big you think you are. LOL. 
I know you from your abortion commentary. Nowhere else. And I am sincerely interested in the political views you espouse."
1619,"@jameelajamil “I can see how badly you want to meet me”, sounds like a Regina George, Mean Girls line. 
Way childish and fictional.

All my best 
Sean."
1923,To sum up I’m saying it’s time to end all abuses of power (especially in the case of George Floyd) and other corruption in whatever form it takes..
1924,"See Rod Rosenstein’s recent testimony and the IG report. 
Then I’ve also been saying over and over on radio &amp; TV that we need to end all of the violence in big cities like Chicago &amp; protect innocent citizens, &amp; fix a broken educational system that is FAILING OUR AMERICAN CHILDREN"
1925,"1% of the FBI tried to take down a duly elected Potus with lies, corruption and abuse of power and that can’t happen either. Look at what that did to this country for over 3 years.  The media mob advanced these lies and conspiracy theories. I told the truth..."
1926,"... 749 innocent cops are now injured, and some have been killed and this cannot continue. 

Then I said at least 6 times on the show tonight, that there is NO comparison, and nothing comparable but we have to end other abuses of power by dirty cops.."
1927,"...and can never happen again. 
When an innocent man dies needlessly there is NOTHING comparable to that as I said. The video of the death of George Floyd is repulsive and has rightly shocked the conscience of the entire country And look at the consequences..."
1928,We all know the damage dirty cops can cause the country as a whole. The Fact is as I have been saying every single day. The horrific Actions of 1 officer &amp; the inaction of 3 officers resulted in the death of an innocent man (fellow American) and this should never have happened..
1929,To me It’s Amazing that when I say over and over and over and specifically “there is no comparison” that the lying media says that I did make a comparison...
1930,".@JonahDispatch  I know we have political disagreements, and I can respect that completely, you are an extremely intelligent writer/commentator. I am making a number of points here that you and a few others seem to be conflating..."

7059,"Listening to Gov Greasy go on &amp; on about how we'll be protecting illegals during this time. Hey buddy, how about those of us who have a legal right to be here? Maybe the open borders agenda wasn't such a good idea after all since we now have to cover illegals during a pandemic..."

7091,"I don’t think we’re any more divided than we’ve ever been. Difference is conservatives are finally starting to stand up for ourselves &amp; the Left isn’t used to being challenged. They are used to us apologizing for what we believe in &amp; cowering in the corner. 

No more."

7446,"Yeah I bet someone who set out to gun down church-goers is one to follow your desired gun control laws. If only we had more laws, then bad guys wouldn’t do bad things, right?!

Idiot. https://t.co/Qbmi4o0R9Z"
7447,"The church shooter must’ve forgot he was in Texas. This incident proves once again the virtue of the Second Amendment. If Democrats like Beto had their way, those church-goers would have been sitting ducks and completely defenseless."
7448,"What a horrible tragedy, thank God a good guy with a gun was able to take him down. https://t.co/KWk8RUD6o8"
7449,Wow. Enough coddling felons. This is such BS. https://t.co/nb21DhW3V8
7450,"Here is what we really need to take a look at in California: which contractors are getting these huge sums of cash to build homeless shelters that have room for very few people but cost a fortune? And, are these companies donating to our politicians? Follow the $$"
7451,The homeless crisis in LA is a function of horrible leadership. I’ll discuss on Trish Regan Primetime in 10 mins.
7452,"One year ago today CA Police Officer Cpl Ronil Singh (a LEGAL immigrant) was murdered by an illegal alien who had been previously arrested for DUI. He left behind a wife and 5 month old son. And yet, you sit there on your throne of bullshit and demonize our border agents. Sick. https://t.co/FzMyJCQP3z"

7455,Well California is about to allow felons to serve on juries. Welcome to the felon-friendly state where law-abiding citizens watch their rights get snatched away while felons and illegal immigrants are handed perks and privileges.

7460,Shocker. https://t.co/igTCx2nXkE
7461,"Question for @govkristinoem , will you be welcoming refugees into the governor’s mansion? Or are you just thrusting them on rural communities that are powerless to say or do anything about it? If you’re a Republican governor, you’re doing a really good job of hiding it."
7462,"Wow. As a South Dakotan and Noem’s first intern back in 2010, this deeply upsets me. If conservative governors start folding like this, I don’t have much hope for the rest of the country. Just wow. https://t.co/uFNVdOojSV"
7463,"Detective Martinez was off-duty working security at IHOP, he broke up a fight and was then assaulted in the parking lot by the suspects and left on the ground. The thugs then got into a car and ran him over, killing him. These animals deserve the death penalty. https://t.co/nyvMVzNOHl"
7464,"Grandpa socialist @BernieSanders and the Dem Darling @AOC have a rally in Venice today. I would say watch out for the needles, tent and sidewalk shit but rumor has it the area was cleaned so as not to show the ravaged filth Democratic policies &amp; leadership created here."
7465,"Take accountability, Gavin. This is your state and you and your democratic cohorts created this mess. You can’t blame @realDonaldTrump forever. Step away from the hair gel and get to work!!! https://t.co/yMmwF7VgFA"
7466,It’s fitting the Democratic Debate was here in LA. I’d encourage those 7 candidates to talk a walk around tomorrow and see what democratic policies (like the ones they want to bring to the national level) have done to the state of CA.
7467,Joe Biden’s face is the perfect symbol of the overall mood of those of us watching this shit show
7468,Was that when you lied about being fired for being pregnant??
7469,Pocahontas thinks confiscating money from the wealthy is the solution to everything. It’s the classic socialist trick- they have something you don’t have and I will use the government to take it.
7470,Pete pulls the veteran and gay card in 5 mins. This is going well.
7471,"Biden, we aren’t “cherry picking” the best people. Millions of illegals spat on our laws and came here illegally."
7472,"Tell the little boy his dad broke the law and when you break the law, you pay the consequences. DON’T COME HERE ILLEGALLY."
7473,We owe illegals who crossed our border illegally compensation? Are you f’n kidding me?
7474,"These democrats conflate “immigrants,” with “illegals.” Not the same thing."
7475,DREAMers is a fancy word for “illegals.” And they aren’t “essentially Americans.” They are illegals.
7476,"Yep, @realDonaldTrump is loving this entire night. Only true thing that’s been said up there."
7477,The RNC and Trump campaign brings in a ton of money because of you a-holes and your baseless witch hunt.
7478,Pocahontas has a lot of stories alright...like back in the day when she was an Indian.
7479,Amy has to figure out that bang shaking ASAP.
7480,"He’s gonna get fired up and call the guy “fat,” I just know it."
7481,"“I’m running because I’ve been around.”

That’s the official Biden slogan. Along with his corn pop moment."
7482,"I love it when they try to make us believe @realDonaldTrump is a coward or thin-skinned. He’s taken on all of you, the mainstream media, and a Clinton (without being added to the accidental suicide body count). He crushes you all and does it brilliantly. Good luck with your TDS."
7483,It all goes back to climate change. I’m surprised Greta wasn’t asked to moderate this debate.
7484,Um...Pete is lying yet again. This president has been in support of the Hong Kong protesters and the toughest on China.
7485,"Let’s go easy on terrorists, right Pocahontas? Sounds like a good idea. Also, our allies aren’t at Gitmo. Thanks."
7486,How have we made it hard for African Americans to vote? Or do mean make it harder for illegals and dead people?
7487,"Bernie doesn’t want to take the opportunity to pander to “black and brown people?”

Nevermind. He did."
7488,"They way they’ve attacked YOU, Joe? Are you freakin’ kidding me. Our President is being put through an endless witch hunt every single day since day one. You’re not a freakin’ victim, Joe."
7489,"They say they care about middle and working class families one second then the next they say, “screw those jobs,” let’s worship the trees."
7490,And Bernie unabashedly says he doesn’t care about American energy production jobs. There you go.
7491,"Listen to this bullshit. I hope you’re paying attention. Biden says he doesn’t care if thousands of blue collar workers lose their jobs. They will just “find something else,” magically."
7492,The all-white debate stage pander phrase of the night: “black and brown people.”
7493,They are blaming CA’s fires on climate change which is a blatant lie. It’s actually the tree hugging forest management rules that f’d this state.
7494,"Now onto the religion of the Left, global warming."
7495,This notion that some people are going to pay for their education and others will get it free is the dumbest thing I’ve heard all night (night is young).
7496,"That’s President Trump to you, Scarecrow."
7497,What Bernie doesn’t say is that he wants a big government solution to all of this. He wants dependence on the government. That’s not freedom.
7498,"Omg Pocahontas, calm down."
7499,I don’t think Yang is a Democrat...
7500,"The American people aren’t in favor of removing Trump, Mr. Scarecrow"
7501,"If you’re worried about foreign intervention, secure the f’n border."
7502,These socialists talking about a threat to democracy....um....okay.
7503,Oh look real quid pro Joe Biden is talking about integrity....
7504,Now this broad is boasting about how blue CA is. It’s called voter fraud and ballot harvesting. And you’re running it into the ground.
7505,"And this lady is using her speech time to talk about our president. Obsessed much? Y’all have no ideas, no platform, no solutions. You just babble about Trump. Get outta here. You’ve already lost."
7506,"Watching @ericgarcetti demonize our President. Hey buddy, have you looked around LA lately? It’s a mess. Get to work."
7507,"Heading to the Democratic Debate. This should be good and by good I mean, a circus! Can’t wait to hear Biden talk about his record player and hairy legs."
7508,The new trade agreement is not complete without country of origin labeling on beef and pork products! No more sketchy meat coming over here and being deceptively labeled “product of USA!”
7509,This is what happens when schools focus more on gender fluidity lessons than civics. Wow. https://t.co/PZofjUu9sF
7510,Hotel California! What a disgrace. https://t.co/luxPOErebm
7511,"We are sick of our so-called “representatives” wasting our taxpayer-funded time on this witch hunt all to garner Pelosi, Schiff and Nadler more TV time. It’s pathetic. https://t.co/kcEKu2wblq"
7512,"This impeachment sham is a sorry attempt to convince people @realDonaldTrump did something wrong, without evidence, in the sorry hope low-information viewers of other networks will buy it. 
My Final Thoughts: https://t.co/kcEKu2wblq https://t.co/YyVfsoBNOq"
7513,"Hatred? This whole witch hunt was fueled by hatred from the Left, from those who can’t stand the fact the country is soaring under this president. You don’t have to like or support @realDonaldTrump but win by voting in 2020, not attempting to nullify the 2016 election. https://t.co/9IzvKaHQ83"

7518,All they’ve done is piss off Trump supporters and converted new ones. Good luck in 2020. You’ve poked the bear. We vote. #Trump2020
7519,"CA Secretary of State @AlexPadilla4CA is bullying other states to adopt our model of rampant voter fraud! Wake up! This crap doesn’t just stay here in CA, it’s spreading. Voter fraud is the real threat. PAY ATTENTION!"
7520,"Remove a POTUS who has done nothing wrong and has done great things for this country? Naw, how about let’s remove all the illegals taking advantage of our country!"
7521,"What message are we sending? Come here illegally, remain here illegally and instead of paying the consequences our government will rubber stamp your illegal activity and hand out perks, like driver’s licenses. 
https://t.co/Uj9RzbBb5f"
7522,"Illegals getting driver’s licenses. Just one step closer to massive voter fraud. Sickening. My Final Thoughts:

7528,"I am not concerned about impeachment, or @realDonaldTrump losing the election. I’m concerned about voter fraud. CA’s model will soon be nationwide. There is no doubt illegals are voting here. There is no doubt this vote-by-mail push is riddled with fraud. Watch out, America."
7529,"If they want to depict Jesus Christ as gay, whatever. I don’t agree with it but free speech is free speech. 

Just a friendly reminder, when cartoonists draw Muhammad all hell breaks loose, literally. #CharlieHebdo"
7530,"The writing is on the wall for the Democrats, this bogus attempt to overthrow @realDonaldTrump  is not only a fruitless endeavor, but a bad political move. I'll discuss with @trish_regan and @cabot_phillips in 30 mins!"
7531,"I’m so sick of the Democrats saying Trump is colluding with foreign entities meanwhile these Democrats are ushering in and handing perks to illegals. If y’all are so worried about foreign intervention, start at the freakin border."
7532,"Love her or hate her, she’s good for the Republican Party! https://t.co/uo6ATYIUJ2 https://t.co/T886yyGuhT"

7536,"It’s sad we’ve come to the point where Democrats hate everyone who supports our President. They think they are better than us. Think about it....law enforcement, border patrol, Christians, Trump voters. The Left despises all of us just because we support @realDonaldTrump"
7537,"Well the Supreme Court lets stand a ruling that allows vagrants to sleep on sidewalks. Wow. Why the hell should hardworking residents and business owners be forced to step over homeless encampments, many of which belong to tweakers and ex-cons? What a crock of crap."
